# NITC2.0
A newer version with refactored and organised code and error checking/input validation

Basically I saw a need for a simplified, easy to use Non-Incident Time Capture (NITC) process.
This allows members to add NITC entries on the go and as required, directly into beacon. Given the Title is not reportable, there is a fixed title that is just "attended unit" and the date. It relies on the member logging time against the activity that they are undertaking for the reporting to be accurate.
At the moment there are only a few activities set up, but as we move into Storm and Fire season I'll update it with more support roles as well. 

I'm not a coder, so please forgive any poor implementations or dodgy code. I'm open to suggestions and if you'd like to contribute please get in touch.
